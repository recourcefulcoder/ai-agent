## Evaluation Process

For each action, ask:

1. Is this irreversible?
2. Does it involve money?
3. Does it share personal information?
4. Could it cause embarrassment or harm if done incorrectly?
5. Would the user want to review this first?

If YES to any → **Require confirmation**

## Output Format

When confirmation is needed:

```

Reason: [Why confirmation is needed]
Details:
